I am a DPhil candidate at the University of Oxford and at the Alan Turing Institute. 

### More Information

I have two streams of research. The first focuses on studying deep probabilistic models, specifically their adversarial robustness and their ability to build representations that are independent and human-interpretable. 
The second dives uses functional analysis and Langevin dynamics to study commonly used regularisation methods, such as Gaussian noise injections.
