I am a DPhil student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at the University of Oxford and at the Alan Turing Institute in London. 

My work is on combining deep learning with Bayesian statistics. The resulting class of models, _deep generative models_ enable us to scale Bayesian approaches to large datasets and complex data like images.

I am interested in three broad areas:

- The robustness of these models, to missing data and to adversarial attack.

- Building highly structured models that enable us to learn representations that are in some sense simple, even human-interpretable. 

- How these models act when scaled up to have deep hierarchies of learnt representations.
